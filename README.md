## Install | Quite crappy install script

It will install python3.6 for arch systems since most likely 3.9+ will be installed.
If you don't want it to, just make sure you have a python3 < 3.9 version and install the requirements

[optional]
Ubuntu-based: mpv version can be a hassle. Make sure you install the latest mpv(repo)/libmpv

    ./install

## Mac

- 3.6 < Python3 < 3.8 from python.org. The brew package has issues with tcl-tk
- youtube-dl env setup can be a pain

  ./install

## Windows

You can follow the Windows release in the
[WindowsBuild branch](https://github.com/lustered/cuteplayer/tree/WindowsBuild)

#### Version without the video integration is deprecated and can be found [here](https://github.com/lustered/cuteplayer/tree/d5c8ed79a82d9102e0cb4ed105045a0696953f3f)

## Known issues

    Hitting the play button will add 1 second every time
